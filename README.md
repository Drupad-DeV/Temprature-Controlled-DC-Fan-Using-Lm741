# Temprature-Controlled-DC-Fan-Using-Lm741
Developing a temperature-controlled DC fan using an **_LM741 Op_** amp and an **_NTC thermistor_** to regulate the bedroom temperature sounds like a promising project to improve sleep quality for people with insomnia.<br>
The **_primary objective_** of this project is to develop a cost-effective and adaptable temperature control system using a temperature-sensitive sensor (NTC thermistor) and an operational amplifier (LM741). By accurately monitoring the ambient temperature, this system will automatically activate or deactivate a DC fan to achieve and maintain the desired temperature setpoint. The key goals of this project include:
